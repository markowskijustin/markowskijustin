### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a PhD Candidate in Health Economics at the Yale School of Public Health. I have begun an academic career focused on the healthcare safety net, applying rigorous empirical methods to policy-relevant questions with the goal of improving health outcomes and reducing disparities.



- ðŸ”­ My current research is focused on studying and optimizing the organization and delivery of healthcare for traditionally underserved populations
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Bayesian approaches to modeling spatial data
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: markowskijustin@gmail.com
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love baking, cooking, film and architecture


## Job Market
I'm on the Job Market this year, looking for academic positions in public health, policy, or affairs! In my job market paper, I study the effects of competition on Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs), a critical and growing part of the health care safety net.
