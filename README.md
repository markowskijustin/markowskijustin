## Hi there 👋

I'm a PhD Candidate in Health Economics at the Yale School of Public Health. I study the healthcare safety net, applying rigorous empirical methods to policy-relevant questions with the goal of improving health outcomes and reducing disparities.



- 🔭 My current research is focused on studying and optimizing the organization and delivery of healthcare for traditionally underserved populations
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Bayesian approaches to modeling spatial data

- ⚡ Fun fact: I love baking, cooking, film and architecture


### Job Market
I'm on the Job Market this year, looking for academic positions in public health, policy, or affairs! In my job market paper, I study the effects of competition on Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs), a critical and growing part of the health care safety net. [Here is a PDF version of the latest working paper](https://github.com/markowskijustin/Competition/blob/main/documentation/Markowski%20Writing%20Sample%20Competition.pdf). I find that FQHCs often respond like for-profit clinics, forgoing their social mission to maintain a competitive edge. 


### Recent Work
I led a study on the effects of health professional shortage area (HPSA) designations on the physician workforce, conducting the first national evaluation that studies this policy over the past 50 years. This manuscript – [now accepted for publication in Health Affairs]() – explores the efficacy over the policy’s lifespan, finding little evidence of any effect on resolving the physician shortage in underserved areas and no significant change in mortality.
